Pong - Created following Christian Thompson's (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2vm-0XX5RkWCXWwtBZGOXg) tutorial
Challenges:
* Thompson uses Python3 and states in the tutorial he doesn't think there are any differences between the versions for this project. I used Python 2 to test that claim, and found that onkeypress() only works in Python 3, while onkey() works in both Python 2 and Python 3.
